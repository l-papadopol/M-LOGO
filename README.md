# M-LOGO â€“ A Free Implementation of the LOGO Interpreter

### Motivations and Objectives

LOGO was the first programming language I encountered during middle school. Its creator, Seymour Papert, developed it primarily for educational purposes, so I decided to use it as a case study for my PMO project.

The goal of the project is to create a stable and functional interpreter capable of:

- Executing LOGO commands in a dialect of my own design.
- Supporting the creation of custom procedures.
- Providing an intuitive graphical interface for user interaction.

---

### Minimal Mandatory Features

- Implementation of the core LOGO commands, similar or identical to the original ones.
- Syntactic validation of inputs to ensure command correctness.
- Ability to create and execute user-defined procedures.
- Management of recursive procedures.

---

### Optional Features

- Saving and loading programs to enable code persistence.
- Printing drawings generated by the interpreter.
- User-defined variables.
- "IF" selection construct.
- "FOR" iteration construct.

---

### Main Challenges

- **Efficient procedure management**: Implementing a system for representing and executing procedures in memory that ensures good performance.
- **Robustness**: The software must handle input errors and unexpected situations without crashing, providing feedback to the user.
- **Intuitive graphical interface**: Based on my experience with Java, I want to design a clear and user-friendly UI that simplifies interaction with the LOGO interpreter.

### Work Distribution

The entire project will be developed by Papadopol Lucian Ioan, personally handling all phases of design and implementation.

### Proposed Class Diagram

The initial modeling stage of the class diagram is as follows. Of course, it may change during the software development cycle, but the choice of an MVC design pattern is already established, and the overall structure should remain consistent.

## Implementation

### Design Pattern Used

This project follows the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture, ensuring a clean separation between:  

- **Model**: Handles core logic and maintains the turtle's state.  
- **View**: Manages graphical rendering (drawing the turtle and executed commands).  
- **Controller**: Interprets user commands and updates the model and view accordingly.  

Additionally, the **Command Design Pattern** is used to encapsulate individual LOGO commands as objects.  
Each command (e.g., `Forward`, `Left`, `Repeat`) is implemented as a separate class with an `execute()` method, allowing flexibility in command execution and future expansion.

### Implemented Commands

The following table lists the **currently implemented** commands, their syntax, and their equivalent LOGO syntax:  

| **Command** | **Syntax (M-LOGO)**     | **Equivalent LOGO Command** | **Description**                                 |
| ----------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Forward     | `FORWARD <steps>`       | `FD <steps>`                | Moves the turtle forward by `<steps>` units.    |
| Back        | `BACK <steps>`          | `BK <steps>`                | Moves the turtle backward by `<steps>` units.   |
| Left        | `LEFT <degrees>`        | `LT <degrees>`              | Rotates the turtle left by `<degrees>`.         |
| Right       | `RIGHT <degrees>`       | `RT <degrees>`              | Rotates the turtle right by `<degrees>`.        |
| PenUp       | `PENUP`                 | `PU`                        | Lifts the pen, so movement does not draw lines. |
| PenDown     | `PENDOWN`               | `PD`                        | Lowers the pen, enabling drawing.               |
| Repeat      | `REPEAT <n> [commands]` | `REPEAT <n> [commands]`     | Repeats the given commands `<n>` times.         |
